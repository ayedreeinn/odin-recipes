                edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust. </li>
            <li>Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. 
                Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes 
                of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving. </li>
